# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project uses sqlalchemy, matplotlib, and Flask to query and display data from an sqlite database about Hawaii weather measurements.

* The jupyter notebook file uses the sqlalchemy ORM to perform queries about the precipitation and temperatures for the last year of measurements and plots the results with matplotlib bar charts and histograms.

* The python app file builds a Flask app, which defines routes to various queries of the data, including two routes that allow the user to query temperature data based on a date range.
